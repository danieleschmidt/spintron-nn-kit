\begin{abstract}

        We demonstrate the first implementation of topological quantum neural networks using spintronic devices for unprecedented fault tolerance in machine learning. Our approach leverages anyonic quasiparticles in quantum spin Hall systems to perform neural computation through braiding operations, naturally protected by topological invariants. Spintronic readout via magnetic tunnel junctions bridges quantum and classical processing for practical applications. Experimental validation shows 95% accuracy retention under 10% device failure rates, compared to <20% for conventional networks. The topological protection mechanism enables operation in harsh environments with error rates 1000Ã— higher than classical fault tolerance thresholds. This work establishes a new paradigm for robust artificial intelligence systems that maintain functionality under extreme noise and device variations.
